          Growing Health and Hope with Osuga (African Nightshade)

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-green-900 dark:text-gray-200 mb-4">
        In 2023, when <span class="font-semibold text-green-700 dark:text-green-400">Green Sprout Kenya</span> 
        was still taking its first steps, we began an ambitious school project at Naya Secondary School. 
        The goal was simple but powerful: to prove that African Indigenous Leafy Vegetables (AILVs) are not just food, 
        but a source of health, income, and sustainability for our communities.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-green-900 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6">
        We chose one of the most cherished vegetables in Kenya â€” the African Nightshade 
        (<span class="italic">Solanum nigrum complex</span>). Known as 
        <span class="font-semibold">Osuga</span> in Luo, 
        <span class="font-semibold">Mnavu</span> in Swahili, and 
        <span class="font-semibold">Managu</span> in Kikuyu, this leafy green has long been part of African diets and traditions. 
        Its edible leaves and berries carry both cultural and nutritional significance.
