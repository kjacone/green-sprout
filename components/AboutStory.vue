    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-green-900">
      Green Sprout Kenya was born in schoolyards and classrooms—where hope for a greener world first took root. What began as a handful of inspired students planting their first saplings has flourished into a vibrant community dedicated to restoring landscapes, empowering youth, and weaving environmental stewardship into the fabric of daily life. Today, children, teachers, and families transform their schools into living laboratories of sustainability—each tree a story of growth, each lesson a seed of change for tomorrow.
